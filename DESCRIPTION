Description: This package makes tidying text that has highly 
    specialized words easier by helping you create a frequency
    table of the words in related free text, clean this frequency 
    table to use it as a corpus, and then check new text with a 
    handy interactive function that outputs any substitutions
    to an R file so everything is reproducible.
